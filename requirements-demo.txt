# Lightweight Requirements for Demo Mode Deployment
# Use this for Render/Railway when PORTFOLIO_DEMO_MODE=True
# Much faster deployment (~1 min vs ~5 min)

# Flask Web Framework
Flask==3.0.0

# Production WSGI Server
gunicorn==21.2.0

# Environment Variables
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# That's it! Demo mode doesn't need ML libraries.
# Total install size: ~50 MB (vs 1.5 GB with full requirements)
